## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.
## Project Motivation
The dataset I am using for this project is the stack-overflow-developer-survey-2021 dataset. This dataset includes data of over 88,000 developers from different regions of the world that uses stack-overflow forum to find solutions to problems they had. The data is based on personal and work related queries of the developers. After reviewing some basics of the dataset, here are a few questions I would like to investigate:
1.	What are the first 10 countries with the highest developers’ participation in the forum?
2.	What is the distribution of educational levels attained by the developers?
3.	What are the most common programming languages worked with?
## File Descriptions
Write a Data Science Blog Post – stack-overflow-developer-survey-2021.ipynb
This notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells & comments were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
The data can also be downloaded from [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).
## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@ayuba.shakiru/data-science-blog-post-2021-stackoverflow-developers-data-analysis-8332750d27d1).
## Acknowledgements
Must give credit to the Udacity Team for making the data available and accessible [here](https://medium.com/@ayuba.shakiru/data-science-blog-post-2021-stackoverflow-developers-data-analysis-8332750d27d1).
